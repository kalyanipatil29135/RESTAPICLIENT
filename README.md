**INTEEN ID** : CT08JKJ 

**DOMAIN** : Java Programming 

** BATCH DURATION** : January 5th, 2024 to February 5th, 2025.

**MENTOR NAME** : Neela Santhosh Kumar

**DESCRIPTION **:

This project involves developing a Java application that interacts with a public REST API, retrieves data, and presents it in a structured format. The application will handle HTTP requests, process JSON responses, and extract relevant information for display. The goal is to build a simple yet effective Java-based client that demonstrates key concepts of RESTful web services consumption, JSON parsing, and structured data presentation.

Key Requirements

API Consumption: The Java application should fetch data from a publicly available REST API, such as OpenWeatherMap (for weather data), CoinGecko (for cryptocurrency prices), or any other API that provides structured JSON responses.

1 HTTP Request Handling: The application must establish a connection with the API server, send requests, and handle responses effectively.

2 JSON Parsing: The received JSON data must be parsed correctly to extract meaningful information.

3 Structured Data Display: The processed data should be presented in an easy-to-read format, such as a console table, graphical user interface (GUI), or formatted text output.

4 Error Handling: The program should handle errors gracefully, including API failures, network issues, or unexpected JSON structures.
